In addition, I&rsquo;ll be switching over to GitHub as a host to keep this blog separate from my business hosting to reduce the attack surface of that site, but I will also utilize this as a learning opportunity for GitHub. I will be completing my bachelors degree in the next 9 months, and I will continue to document my personal projects like my custom built MAME arcades and other technology related projects and tutorials.</p>
