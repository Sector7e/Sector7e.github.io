      <description>The Sector 7e blog is now transitioning over to Hugo, and I will be working on transferring over the old content soon. The old blog relied on WordPress which is a common target for hackers and bots to compromise or deface for malicious reasons, so I decided this was a good opportunity to learn the static site generator framework known as Hugo. Because the blog will be generated as a static HTML site with many of the same features as WordPress, but it will be less likely to be compromised than a dynamic content management system that contains a dynamic web application that can execute code and a MySQL database.</description>
